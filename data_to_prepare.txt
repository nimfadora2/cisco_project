IDEAS to solve the project

1. Read the file with ip range
2. For each address in ip range ping (troubles with optimalization :( - any ideas? Or just one ip address - and rest from that)
3. If ip valid - we have response:
	3.1. Log into by ssh
	3.2 Gather appropriate information - all we can
	3.3 Save the data to database? Or txt file? Or somtehing else?
4. When ip range ends we need to appropriately cluster the data - topology etc.
5. Print everything - topology (by graphs?) , data collected in tables etc. etc.


Any ideas? ;)

Tasks to preapre:

TOPOLOGY - for start 

1. Part for logging and collecting the data - saving to dataabse.
2. Part for calculating.
3. Part for displaying everything - this could be split to some smaller tasks ;)
